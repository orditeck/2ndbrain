Have you ever heard, in August 2022, the story of the dad who got ban from his Google account for ‘child porn’ after he sent pics of his toddler’s swollen genitals to his doctor? [^1][^2]

I have young children. When I read that story, it scared the hell out of me. It could've been me. 

Image loosing all your emails, your pictures of your kids growing up, your documents, etc. 

What happened? An algorithm automatically flagged the images, and then human moderators deemed them in violation of Google’s rules. The police determined that the fathers had committed no crime, **but the company still deleted their accounts**.

There's also [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1aqydp/googles_automated_ban_system_has_been_suspending/) from 10 years ago with several examples of users wrongfully banned from their Google account. Another example [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/zuuf84/my_account_was_disabled_for_a_false_violation_of/). 

In December 2022, a mother also had her Google account banned because of a video where her child was dancing naked[^3]. This case was different and she eventually got her account back, but I primarily wanted to share this part of the article:

> Jason Scott, a digital archivist who wrote [a memorably profane](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/1717) blog post in 2009 warning people not to trust the cloud, said companies should be legally obligated to give users their data, even when an account was closed for rule violations.
> 
> “Data storage should be like tenant law,” Mr. Scott said. “You shouldn’t be able to hold someone’s data and not give it back.”

I couldn't agree more. Yet, they can. 

Or let's say for whatever reason, you buy something from Google and get yourself into a situation where you do a charghbeback with your credit card company. Google will ban you. For them (and for Sony, Nintendo, etc. who do the same), this means the end of the business relationship. While logical, it's hard to phantom how much Google's leverage over your life can be huge if you let yourself be blindly content by their service and end up using all of them for your digital life.

They make awesome product. But the more you use them, the more Google own your data and, eventually, they own ... a part of you.
