## Introduction

In the age of digitalization, we have become increasingly reliant on technology to store and manage our personal information. Many of us have turned to tech giants like Google for their user-friendly and efficient services, which have become an integral part of our daily routines. However, recent incidents have shown that such dependence may come at a cost. The risk of losing access to our accounts or having our data compromised is a real and terrifying possibility. This blog post delves into the debate of whether it is worth trusting Google with our data or taking control of our privacy and opting for alternative services. We will explore the pros and cons of staying within the Google ecosystem, as well as alternative solutions for those who value privacy and data control.

Google has faced criticism for their handling of user data, including incidents where users' private information has been accessed without their consent.

In August 2022, a father was banned from Google for sending photos of his child's swollen genitals to their doctor. [^1] [^2] While the intention was to seek medical advice, Google's automated systems flagged the photos as child pornography and banned the father from accessing his Google account, including his email and all of his stored data.

This case is concerning because it highlights how Google's algorithm and automated system for detecting inappropriate content can be flawed and potentially harm innocent people. As a father of three young children, the idea of being wrongly accused of sharing inappropriate content of my own children and being banned from Google's services is worrying. It raises questions about how Google's system works, who has access to our personal data, and how it is being monitored and analyzed. It also highlights the need for more transparency and accountability when it comes to these automated systems that can have a significant impact on people's lives.

Image loosing all your emails, your pictures of your kids growing up, your important documents, etc. Getting banned from your Google account can be a nightmare. 

The police determined that the fathers had committed no crime, **but the company still deleted his account**.

Anecdotal, you'd say? Not according to [this 10 year old reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1aqydp/googles_automated_ban_system_has_been_suspending/) filled with examples of users wrongfully banned from their Google account. Another example [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/zuuf84/my_account_was_disabled_for_a_false_violation_of/). 

In December 2022, a mother also had her Google account banned because of a video where her child was dancing naked[^3]. This case was different and she eventually got her account back, but I primarily wanted to share this part of the article:

> Jason Scott, a digital archivist who wrote [a memorably profane](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/1717) blog post in 2009 warning people not to trust the cloud, said companies should be legally obligated to give users their data, even when an account was closed for rule violations.
> 
> “Data storage should be like tenant law,” Mr. Scott said. “You shouldn’t be able to hold someone’s data and not give it back.”

I couldn't agree more.

These stories demonstrate the potential consequences of relying too heavily on a single company for your data storage and online services. Being banned from your Google account can mean losing access to critical data and services, as well as facing accusations of wrongdoing that can have long-lasting and traumatic effects. It is important to consider these risks when deciding where to store your data and which online services to use.

## What does Google use my data for?

Well, I'm glad you asked!

As you may know, Google's primary source of revenue comes from advertising. In fact, in their latest financial report, they reported that a whopping 81% of their total revenue comes from ads, which amounts to approximately $147 billion dollars in 2020 alone.

To show us ads that are relevant to our interests, Google collects data on our online behavior and creates a profile for each user. This profiling includes data such as our search history, location data, and even the content of our emails.

If you want to see just how much information Google has collected about you, you can check out the [My Ad Center](https://myadcenter.google.com/controls) section of your Google account. Here, you'll see a list of categories that Google believes represent your interests, as well as the demographic information they've collected about you. For example, if you're married, your household income, your education, the industry you work in, your employer size, whether you're a homeowner or a renter, without children or if so, what grade, etc.

Now, did you really **consciously** decided to let Google know that much about you and your family?

While some people may not mind being targeted with ads, others may find this level of tracking invasive and uncomfortable. This is another reason why some people choose to move away from the Google ecosystem and find alternative services that prioritize their privacy.

But wait, there's more. 

Take a minute to explore it by yourself:

	- E.g.: 40,000 photos, 800 apps, 10 followed news source, 400+ files, 118 shared with you, 54,000 conversations in Gmail, 3 calendars, 2 payment profiles, 2 Android backups, 58 books in your library, 397 bookmarks in Chrome, 946 passwords saved, 219 contacts, 102 notes in Keep, 6 completed tasks, … And that's just the TLDR / summarize view. Go in details. Go on!
- [My Google Activity](https://myactivity.google.com): My Activity is a central place to view and manage activity such as searches you've done, websites you've visited, and videos you've watched.

## To stay or to move away

Now, if you've made it that far in this page, you may be wondering what your options are. 

Is it possible to balance the convenience and accessibility of Google's services with your desire for privacy and ownership over your data?

Users who prioritize privacy and data ownership may want to move away from the Google ecosystem due to concerns around data collection, surveillance, and potential account bans. Other reasons include the desire to support smaller companies, avoid ad targeting, and have more control over data. 

However, those who value convenience, integration, and access to high-quality products and services may choose to stay within the Google ecosystem despite privacy concerns. Ultimately, the decision to stay or leave depends on individual priorities and risk tolerance.

Let's explore a bit of both sides.

## 10 reasons to move away from Google

1.  Google tracks and collects a vast amount of data about its users, including their search history, location data, and even voice commands. This data can be used to target you with personalized ads and may be vulnerable to hacks or breaches.
    
2.  Google has access to your emails and documents stored on its servers. While Google claims to protect your data, there is always a risk of a data breach or unauthorized access to your information.
    
3.  Google has been criticized for its lack of transparency around how it collects and uses data. It is not always clear what data Google is collecting, how it is being used, and who it is being shared with.
    
4.  Google's business model is built around using your data to sell targeted ads. If you are uncomfortable with this, there are alternative search engines and email providers that do not rely on targeted ads.
    
5.  Google is known to cooperate with government surveillance programs and has faced legal challenges over its data-sharing practices.
    
6.  Google's data collection practices can have real-world consequences. For example, in 2018, it was revealed that Google was using location data from Android devices to track users' movements, even when location services were turned off.
    
7.  Google's dominance in the search engine market means that it has significant control over what information is accessible online. Some users may prefer to support smaller, more independent search engines that prioritize privacy and security.
    
8.  Google's products are not always designed with privacy in mind. For example, Google Assistant is constantly listening for voice commands, which can be a concern for users who want to protect their privacy.
    
9.  There are many alternative services that prioritize privacy and security, such as DuckDuckGo for search, ProtonMail for email, and Signal for messaging.
    
10.  By using alternative services, you can take more control over your data and reduce your reliance on a single company for all of your online needs. This can help to protect your privacy and reduce the risk of data breaches or other privacy violations.

## 10 reasons to stay within the Google ecosystem

1.  Integration: One of the main benefits of staying within the Google ecosystem is that all of their products and services are seamlessly integrated, making it easy to move between apps and services without losing data or functionality.
    
2.  Familiarity: If you have been using Google products for a long time, you may be comfortable with their interface and find it difficult to switch to other platforms.
    
3.  Accessibility: Google services are widely available across multiple platforms and devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.
    
4.  User support: Google offers extensive customer support for their products, including online forums, user guides, and dedicated customer service representatives.
    
5.  Collaboration: Google provides a range of collaborative tools, such as Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, which make it easy to work with others in real-time.
    
6.  Third-party integration: Many third-party apps and services integrate with Google products, making it easy to connect with other tools you use.
    
7.  Artificial intelligence: Google's services often incorporate AI technology to provide personalized recommendations, search results, and other features.
    
8.  Advanced features: Google offers a range of advanced features in their products, such as machine learning-powered photo editing in Google Photos and advanced search tools in Google Search.
    
9.  Free services: Many of Google's products and services are free to use, which is a significant advantage over other platforms that may require paid subscriptions.
    
10.  Innovation: Google is constantly innovating and releasing new products and services, which may provide new opportunities for you to improve your productivity, creativity, or personal life.

## Explore moving away

Moving away from Google can feel like a daunting task, but I'm glad to see that you're ready to take the first step. Let's start with something manageable and not too overwhelming.

A good place to start would be to move away old photos and documents that you don't access often to a local storage that you own. An external hard drive or a Network Attached Storage (NAS) could be great options for this. However, it's essential to back up your data because if something happens to your primary storage device. For example, if your hard drive gets damaged, stolen, or lost, you could lose all your photos, documents, and other important data. That's why it's crucial to back up your data regularly to ensure you never lose it.

To keep your data secure, we should encrypt it before uploading it to a remote server. It's essential to encrypt our data to protect our privacy and prevent unauthorized access to our information. When you encrypt your data, you scramble it in a way that makes it unreadable without a decryption key. By encrypting our data, we can ensure that it stays safe and private, even if it falls into the wrong hands. I suggest using a VeraCrypt volume for encryption. VeraCrypt is an open-source tool that allows you to create encrypted volumes or containers that are password-protected. We will dive deeper into this in a more technical guide later on.

I also understand the importance of having quick and easy access to your data. To address this, we will also explore online solutions like NextCloud, which is a secure and private cloud storage alternative that you can run on your own server or rent from a hosting provider. NextCloud will allow you to access your files and data from anywhere, at any time, just like Google Drive.

I'm here to help you through this transition, and we can take it one step at a time. Let's start with the easy ones and then move forward as you become more comfortable. Don't hesitate to reach out in the comment section if you have any questions.

## Move-away Guide

### Email & Calendar: ProtonMail & ProtonCalendar

Google scans your email. 

>We use automated systems that analyze your content
><sub>Source: [Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy)</sub>

The scanning is done automatically and is part of their process to offer targeted advertising to you. The content of your emails is analyzed to determine what topics are being discussed, and then ads related to those topics are displayed to you. Google states that their scanning process is fully automated and no human reads your emails. However, it's important to note that the contents of your emails are still being processed and used to target ads to you.

They wanted to make sure you **really** understand:

>We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
><sub>Source: [Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy)</sub>

ProtonMail is an email service that prioritizes privacy. It's a Swiss-based company that offers end-to-end encryption on all emails, meaning only you and the intended recipient can read the message.

It is a good alternative if you're concerned about your online privacy and security, particularly with regards to your email communications. By using ProtonMail, you can have greater confidence that your emails are protected from prying eyes and that your personal data is not being used for advertising or other purposes.

### Photos & Videos: Photoprism

### Documents: NextCloud

I don't think I'm ready to move away from Google Docs & Sheets. I don't store any sensitive information on Drive. I have a few spreadsheets to keep track of a few things like our fixed monthly expenses, in what device are the rechargeable batteries, etc. Nothing very sensitive. I also use Notion for similar things that I want in a database format. 

I tried NextCloud with Collabora Online Development Edition (CODE) but found it a bit slow and I just don't think it's worth maintaining up to date these software for my use. 

If I were to ditch both, I'd probably simply go offline with Libre Office or even Microsoft Office.
