### QNAP
![[Pasted image 20230205113100.png]]
#### Usage
Network Attached Storage (NAS): a storage that's available to all devices on the network.

I keep it very barebone as it's not a powerful machine.

Divided in two volumes:
1. Family (4TB)
	- Photos
	- Documents
	- Syncthing directories
2. Stuff (12TB)
	- Torrents
	- Security Cameras recordings
	- Proxmox backups

Apps installed:
- [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) installed through the QPKG Store. It is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes.

Off-site backups:
- To Wasabi (S3-like) for all important data.
- Also a real-time sync with Google Drive for my daily Syncthing directory for convenience, but that's something I'm aiming to remove in the near future since I haven't used Google Drive for ages.

#### Specs
- Model: TS-431P
- CPU: ARM Cortex-A15 CPU @ 1.70GHz 
- RAM: 1GB DDR3
- Disks: 
	- 2x 4TB RAID 1, Encrypted
	- 2x 12TB RAID 1, Non Encrypted

### Ubiquiti APs

#### Usage
Wi-Fi 6 was an upgrade I was looking forward to and I was not disappointed! One LR AP seems enough for the house. We also have one AP in the shed in repeater/mesh mode as I'm planning to eventually have a smart 240v plug in there to remotely turn on/off the heat.

#### Cost
- AP 6 Long-Range: $250 in January 2022
- 3x AP AC Lite: 
	- 1x $137 in April 2018
