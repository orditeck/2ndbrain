## Introduction

In today's digital age, our personal data has become a highly valued commodity for tech companies. Google, as one of the largest tech giants, relies heavily on collecting and analyzing user data to serve targeted ads, generating a significant portion of their revenue. Our dependence on Google's services, such as email, search, and cloud storage, has made it easy for them to collect and store our data. However, recent incidents have highlighted the potential risks of such dependence, including data breaches, account hijacking and account getting wrongfully banned. 

In this blog post, we will explore the importance of our data to Google and the potential consequences of trusting them with our personal information. We will also discuss alternative solutions for those who value privacy and data control, including the use of alternative services like ProtonMail, PhotoPrism and NextCloud.

Google has faced criticism for their handling of user data, including incidents where users' private information has been accessed without their consent.

In recent years, there have been several incidents involving Google and the security and privacy of user data. In 2018, it was discovered that a bug in Google+ had exposed the personal data of up to 500,000 users to outside developers ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Google_data_breach)). This led to the shut down of Google+ in 2019. Additionally, in 2019, it was reported that a Google contractor had leaked over 1,000 audio recordings from Google Home devices to a Belgian news organization. The recordings contained sensitive and personal information of users.

In August 2022, a father was banned from Google for sending photos of his child's swollen genitals to their doctor. While the intention was to seek medical advice, Google's automated systems flagged the photos as child pornography and banned the father from accessing his Google account, including his email and all of his stored data.

Losing access to all of your emails, photos, and important documents can be a complete nightmare. What's worse, in the case of the fathers who were wrongly accused, even though the police found that they had committed no crime, **Google still deleted their account**, leaving them without access to all of their important data. This highlights the lack of accountability and transparency in how these automated systems are monitored and analyzed, and raises questions about the potential harm they can cause.

As a father of three young children, the idea of being wrongly accused of sharing inappropriate content of my own children and being banned from Google's services is worrying. 

> Jason Scott, a digital archivist who wrote [a memorably profane](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/1717) blog post in 2009 warning people not to trust the cloud, said companies should be legally obligated to give users their data, even when an account was closed for rule violations.
> 
> “Data storage should be like tenant law,” Mr. Scott said. “You shouldn’t be able to hold someone’s data and not give it back.”

I couldn't agree more.

These stories demonstrate the potential consequences of relying too heavily on a single company for your data storage and online services. Being banned from your Google account can mean losing access to critical data and services, as well as facing accusations of wrongdoing that can have long-lasting and traumatic effects. It is important to consider these risks when deciding where to store your data and which online services to use.

## The Trade-Off: Google vs. Privacy

As you may know, Google's primary source of revenue comes from advertising. In fact, in their latest financial report, they reported that a whopping 81% of their total revenue comes from ads, which amounts to approximately $147 billion dollars in 2020 alone.

To show us ads that are relevant to our interests, Google collects data on our online behavior and creates a profile for each user. This profiling includes data such as our search history, location data, and even the content of our emails.

<sup>Disclamer: all the infographics used below were made by Alice Bonasio and taken from their article [How Much Does Google Know About You?](https://medium.com/edtech-trends/infographic-how-much-does-google-know-about-you-d5ee5bd6d01d) </sup>

![[Pasted image 20230218191013.png]]

Some would even argue that Google's business model, which relies on collecting and monetizing user data, creates a potential conflict of interest and puts user privacy at risk.

If you want to see just how much information Google has collected about you, you can check out the [My Ad Center](https://myadcenter.google.com/controls) section of your Google account. Here, you'll see a list of categories that Google believes represent your interests, as well as the demographic information they've collected about you. For example, if you're married, your household income, your education, the industry you work in, your employer size, whether you're a homeowner or a renter, without children or if so, what grade, etc.

Now, did you really **consciously** decided to let Google know that much about you and your family?

While some people may not mind being targeted with ads, others may find this level of tracking invasive and uncomfortable. This is another reason why some people choose to move away from the Google ecosystem and find alternative services that prioritize their privacy.

But wait, there's more. 

Take a minute to explore it by yourself:

- [Google Dashboard](https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard): See a summary of the services you use and the data saved in your Google Account
	- E.g.: 40,000 photos, 800 apps, 10 followed news source, 400+ files, 118 shared with you, 54,000 conversations in Gmail, 3 calendars, 2 payment profiles, 2 Android backups, 58 books in your library, 397 bookmarks in Chrome, 946 passwords saved, 219 contacts, 102 notes in Keep, 6 completed tasks, … And that's just the TLDR / summarize view. Go in details. Go on!
- [My Google Activity](https://myactivity.google.com): My Activity is a central place to view and manage activity such as searches you've done, websites you've visited, and videos you've watched.

### To stay or to move away

Now, if you've made it that far in this page, you may be wondering what your options are. 

Is it possible to balance the convenience and accessibility of Google's services with your desire for privacy and ownership over your data?

Users who prioritize privacy and data ownership may want to move away from the Google ecosystem due to concerns around data collection, surveillance, and potential account bans. Other reasons include the desire to support smaller companies, avoid ad targeting, and have more control over data. 

However, those who value convenience, integration, and access to high-quality products and services may choose to stay within the Google ecosystem despite privacy concerns. Ultimately, the decision to stay or leave depends on individual priorities and risk tolerance.

Let's explore a bit of both sides.

### 10 reasons to move away from Google

1.  Google tracks and collects a vast amount of data about its users, including their search history, location data, and even voice commands. This data can be used to target you with personalized ads and may be vulnerable to hacks or breaches.
    
2.  Google has access to your emails and documents stored on its servers. While Google claims to protect your data, there is always a risk of a data breach or unauthorized access to your information.
    
3.  Google has been criticized for its lack of transparency around how it collects and uses data. It is not always clear what data Google is collecting, how it is being used, and who it is being shared with.
    
4.  Google's business model is built around using your data to sell targeted ads. If you are uncomfortable with this, there are alternative search engines and email providers that do not rely on targeted ads.
    
5.  Google is known to cooperate with government surveillance programs and has faced legal challenges over its data-sharing practices.
    
6.  Google's data collection practices can have real-world consequences. For example, in 2018, it was revealed that Google was using location data from Android devices to track users' movements, even when location services were turned off.
    
7.  Google's dominance in the search engine market means that it has significant control over what information is accessible online. Some users may prefer to support smaller, more independent search engines that prioritize privacy and security.
    
8.  Google's products are not always designed with privacy in mind. For example, Google Assistant is constantly listening for voice commands, which can be a concern for users who want to protect their privacy.
    
9.  There are many alternative services that prioritize privacy and security, such as DuckDuckGo for search, ProtonMail for email, and Signal for messaging.
    
10.  By using alternative services, you can take more control over your data and reduce your reliance on a single company for all of your online needs. This can help to protect your privacy and reduce the risk of data breaches or other privacy violations.

### 10 reasons to stay within the Google ecosystem

1.  Integration: One of the main benefits of staying within the Google ecosystem is that all of their products and services are seamlessly integrated, making it easy to move between apps and services without losing data or functionality.
    
2.  Familiarity: If you have been using Google products for a long time, you may be comfortable with their interface and find it difficult to switch to other platforms.
    
3.  Accessibility: Google services are widely available across multiple platforms and devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.
    
4.  User support: Google offers extensive customer support for their products, including online forums, user guides, and dedicated customer service representatives.

6.  Third-party integration: Many third-party apps and services integrate with Google products, making it easy to connect with other tools you use.
    
7.  Artificial intelligence: Google's services often incorporate AI technology to provide personalized recommendations, search results, and other features.
    
8.  Advanced features: Google offers a range of advanced features in their products, such as machine learning-powered photo editing in Google Photos and advanced search tools in Google Search.
    
9.  Free services: Many of Google's products and services are free to use, which is a significant advantage over other platforms that may require paid subscriptions.
    
10.  Innovation: Google is constantly innovating and releasing new products and services, which may provide new opportunities for you to improve your productivity, creativity, or personal life.

## Alternatives to Google Services

Moving away from Google can feel like a daunting task, but I'm glad to see that you're ready to take the first step. Let's start with something manageable and not too overwhelming.

A good place to start would be to move away old photos and documents that you don't access often to a local storage that you own. An external hard drive or a Network Attached Storage (NAS) could be great options for this. However, it's essential to back up your data because if something happens to your primary storage device. For example, if your hard drive gets damaged, stolen, or lost, you could lose all your photos, documents, and other important data. That's why it's crucial to back up your data regularly to ensure you never lose it.

To keep your data secure, we should encrypt it before uploading it to a remote server. It's essential to encrypt our data to protect our privacy and prevent unauthorized access to our information. When you encrypt your data, you scramble it in a way that makes it unreadable without a decryption key. By encrypting our data, we can ensure that it stays safe and private, even if it falls into the wrong hands. I suggest using a VeraCrypt volume for encryption. VeraCrypt is an open-source tool that allows you to create encrypted volumes or containers that are password-protected. We will dive deeper into this in a more technical guide later on.

I also understand the importance of having quick and easy access to your data. To address this, we will also explore online solutions like NextCloud, which is a secure and private cloud storage alternative that you can run on your own server or rent from a hosting provider. NextCloud will allow you to access your files and data from anywhere, at any time, just like Google Drive.

I'm here to help you through this transition, and we can take it one step at a time. Let's start with the easy ones and then move forward as you become more comfortable. Don't hesitate to reach out in the comment section if you have any questions.

### Email & Calendar

#### ProtonMail & ProtonCalendar

Google scans your email. 

>We use automated systems that analyze your content
><sub>Source: [Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy)</sub>

The scanning is done automatically and is part of their process to offer targeted advertising to you. The content of your emails is analyzed to determine what topics are being discussed, and then ads related to those topics are displayed to you. Google states that their scanning process is fully automated and no human reads your emails. However, it's important to note that the contents of your emails are still being processed and used to target ads to you.

They wanted to make sure you **really** understand:

>We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
><sub>Source: [Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy)</sub>

ProtonMail is an email service that prioritizes privacy. It's a Swiss-based company that offers end-to-end encryption on all emails, meaning only you and the intended recipient can read the message.

It is a good alternative if you're concerned about your online privacy and security, particularly with regards to your email communications. By using ProtonMail, you can have greater confidence that your emails are protected from prying eyes and that your personal data is not being used for advertising or other purposes.

Follow their [migration guide](https://proton.me/support/switch-from-gmail-to-proton) to move from Gmail to ProtonMail in a matter of minutes.

### Photos & Videos

#### Photoprism

PhotoPrism is an open-source, self-hosted application for managing and sharing your personal photo collection. It provides features like automatic tagging, image recognition, and search capabilities, as well as allows you to store and access your photos from anywhere.

PhotoPrism can be a good alternative to Google Photos because it is a self-hosted, open-source platform, which means that you have complete control over your photos and you do not need to rely on a third-party service provider to manage them for you. Additionally, PhotoPrism offers features similar to Google Photos such as automatic tagging and image recognition, which can make it easier to organize your collection.

However, PhotoPrism may not be a good alternative to Google Photos for some users, as it requires more technical knowledge to set up and maintain compared to Google Photos. Additionally, hosting your own photos requires more storage space and may involve additional costs for purchasing hardware or using a cloud storage service. Finally, while PhotoPrism is constantly evolving, it may not have all the features that Google Photos has or may not have the same level of polish in the user interface.

According to the PhotoPrism [documentation](https://docs.photoprism.app/user-guide/organize/people/#asian-faces-and-children), it's a known issue that their AI model can't reliably recognize children's faces. This is because the training data used to develop the model does not contain many images of children, which is due to the fact that parents do not typically share pictures of their children under a public license.

It makes perfect sense that parents would not want their children's images to be used as part of a training dataset for AI. Many parents are rightly concerned about the privacy and safety of their children online, and may not want their children's images to be used in any way that they cannot control.

On the other hand, it is reasonable to assume that Google's AI is able to recognize children's faces because they have access to a vast amount of data, including photos and videos uploaded by their users. Google's privacy policy states that they may use the images you upload to their services, including Google Photos, to improve their products and services, including their facial recognition technology.

So, while it is understandable that some users may be uncomfortable with the idea of their photos being used in this way, it is important to understand that companies like Google have access to vast amounts of data, which allows them to train their AI models to recognize a wide range of features, including facial recognition. PhotoPrism, on the other hand, is a self-hosted alternative that does not use cloud services or data processing from third-party companies, which can be a good option for users who are concerned about privacy and control over their data. However, as noted earlier, it may not be as accurate in recognizing certain faces, such as those of children and people of Asian descent, due to limitations in the training dataset.

### Documents

Managing your documents on your local computer means that you store your files on your computer's hard drive and can access them locally. This method of document management requires that you have access to the device where the files are stored and limits your ability to access the files remotely. 

However, with an open source solution like NextCloud, a cloud-based platform for file storage, sharing, and collaboration, you can store and access your files remotely from anywhere. Features such as version control, file history, and sharing permissions make document management easier and more secure. By using NextCloud, you can ensure the privacy and security of your data, avoiding third-party scanning and analysis. Additionally, it offers end-to-end encryption, which means that only you and those you share your files with can access the information, a level of security not offered by Google Drive.

#### Non-collaborative: Syncthing

[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) is a free, open-source, peer-to-peer file synchronization tool that allows you to keep your files synchronized across multiple devices. It is a decentralized and secure alternative to cloud-based file synchronization services, such as Google Drive and Dropbox, which store your data on remote servers.

With Syncthing, you can sync your files between your devices without having to rely on a third-party service or trust them with your data. This can be particularly useful if you want to keep your files private and secure, as well as avoid potential privacy violations by big tech companies.

One of the advantages of Syncthing is that it allows you to sync your files across different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. This means that you can access your files from any of your devices, regardless of the platform you're using. Additionally, Syncthing provides advanced features, such as selective sync, which allows you to choose which folders to sync between devices, and versioning, which keeps track of changes made to your files and allows you to restore previous versions.

Overall, Syncthing can be a great tool for managing your files privately and securely while still being able to access them easily from your devices. It is easy to set up and use, and provides a great alternative to cloud-based file synchronization services.

Syncthing does not include an office suite so you'll need an offline solution like [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or Microsoft Office.

#### Collaborative: NextCloud

Collabora Online

## How to protect your online privacy

### The very basic

1.  Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
2.  Be mindful of what personal information you share online.
3.  Review privacy settings on social media accounts and adjust as needed.
4.  Only download apps and software from trusted sources.
5.  Be wary of phishing emails and scams.
6.  Use two-factor authentication whenever possible.
7.  Regularly update your devices and software.
8.  Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions.
9.  Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) for added security.
10.  Always log out of accounts when using public computers.

### Block Ads, Tracking & Phishing

AdGuard is an ad-blocking and privacy protection tool that can help you enhance your online privacy. Here are some ways AdGuard can help:

1.  Ad blocking: AdGuard blocks ads and pop-ups, reducing the number of third-party scripts and trackers that collect your data.
    
2.  Anti-tracking: AdGuard blocks tracking scripts and cookies, preventing advertisers from tracking your online activities and personalizing ads.
    
3.  DNS filtering: AdGuard uses DNS filtering to block malicious websites and prevent phishing attacks, protecting you from online threats.
    
4.  Stealth mode: AdGuard's Stealth mode prevents websites from detecting your ad-blocker, protecting you from anti-ad-blocker scripts.
    
5.  Parental controls: AdGuard's parental controls allow you to filter out inappropriate content for children.
    

By using AdGuard, you can enjoy a faster and more secure browsing experience, with less ads and fewer online threats.

### Use a secret tunnel to communicate with the Internet 

#### What is a VPN?
Imagine you're in a secret club, and you want to talk to your friend about your secret club stuff, but you don't want anyone else to hear you. So, you and your friend put a blanket over your heads to make a secret tent where no one can hear you.

A VPN is like that secret tent blanket, but for your internet connection. When you use a VPN, it creates a secret tunnel between your computer and the internet, which keeps your internet activity private and safe from people who might be snooping. It's like a secret hideout for your internet connection!

#### Why use a VPN
In 2011, during the Arab Spring protests in Egypt, the government shut down the internet in an attempt to quell the protests. This left citizens unable to communicate with each other or access information from outside the country. However, some citizens were able to use VPNs to bypass the government's censorship and access the internet.

VPNs allowed citizens to connect to servers outside of Egypt, which in turn gave them access to the internet and the ability to communicate with people outside of the country. This was critical in spreading information about the protests and coordinating actions. 
<sub>[Source](https://www.theverge.com/2011/1/31/1964654/how-egypt-turned-off-the-internet)</sub>

Using a VPN can help protect your online privacy by encrypting your internet connection and masking your IP address, making it more difficult for third parties to track your online activity and identify your location. It can also help bypass internet censorship and geo-restrictions.

#### VPN + AdGuard?
While a VPN provides privacy and security by encrypting your internet connection, AdGuard can provide additional benefits by blocking ads, trackers, and malware at the network level, preventing them from reaching your device in the first place. AdGuard can also help speed up your browsing experience by reducing the amount of data being downloaded and improving page load times. By using both a VPN and AdGuard together, you can enhance your online privacy and security while also improving your browsing experience.

### Use an encrypted messaging apps

Telegram and Signal are both popular messaging apps that focus on providing users with secure and private communication. While both apps offer end-to-end encryption, which means that only the sender and receiver can access the messages, there are some differences between them.

Signal is an open-source app that is widely considered to be the gold standard for secure messaging. It is endorsed by privacy advocates and has been recommended by organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Signal is designed to collect as little data as possible, and it is run by a non-profit organization that is committed to privacy and security.

Telegram, on the other hand, is a cloud-based messaging app that is known for its speed and features. While it also offers end-to-end encryption, its default settings do not enable this feature for all messages, and it collects more user data than Signal. Additionally, Telegram has been criticized for its lack of transparency in how it handles user data and encryption.

In terms of which app is better, it depends on your specific needs and priorities. If you prioritize privacy and security above all else, Signal is likely the better choice. If you are more interested in features and speed, Telegram may be a better option. Ultimately, both apps offer a high level of security and privacy compared to many other messaging apps, and it is up to the user to decide which app is the best fit for them.

### Use a privacy-focused browser

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/) and [Brave](https://brave.com/) share many similarities as privacy-focused browsers that prioritize user privacy and security. They both provide built-in ad and tracker blocking, password managers, and support for private browsing mode. Moreover, they are both open-source and transparent about their code and development process, with a strong commitment to user control and customization for a better browsing experience.

One significant difference is that Firefox is developed by Mozilla, a non-profit organization with a longer history of development and a larger community of developers, which may give users more confidence in its security and privacy features. On the other hand, Brave, a for-profit company, offers an interesting "privacy-respecting ads" feature that uses local machine learning algorithms to serve relevant ads without compromising user data. Additionally, Brave has a [built-in Tor integration](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018121491-What-is-a-Private-Window-with-Tor-Connectivity-) feature, which allows users to browse the internet anonymously and hide their IP address and location from third parties.

Overall, both browsers offer powerful privacy features, but users may choose one over the other depending on their unique needs and preferences.

Compare them [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/browsers/compare/brave/).

### Use two-factor authentication

#### What is Two-factor authentication
Two-factor authentication is like having two keys to unlock your treasure chest. The first key is your password, which you have to remember, like the secret word to open the chest. The second key is something you have with you, like a special toy that only you have. When you want to open the chest, you need to use both keys at the same time. That way, even if someone finds out your password, they can't open the chest because they don't have the special toy key. Two-factor authentication makes it harder for bad guys to get into your important stuff online.

#### YubiKey
A YubiKey is a physical hardware device that can be used for two-factor authentication (2FA), which adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. When you use a YubiKey, you plug it into your computer or mobile device and then press a button on the device to authenticate your login. This helps ensure that only you can access your accounts, even if someone else gets hold of your password.

The benefits of using a YubiKey for two-factor authentication include:

1.  **Stronger Security**: Using a YubiKey significantly reduces the risk of account breaches due to stolen or weak passwords, as well as phishing attacks. This is because an attacker would need both your password and the physical YubiKey device to gain access to your account, making it much harder to hack into your accounts.
    
2.  **Convenience**: Using a YubiKey is more convenient than other 2FA methods such as one-time passwords sent via text message or authenticator apps. With a YubiKey, you simply plug it into your computer or mobile device and press a button to authenticate your login, making the login process faster and easier. Additionally, YubiKeys can be used across multiple devices and services, reducing the need for multiple 2FA methods.
    

In addition to USB keys, YubiKey also offers keys with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. NFC-enabled keys allow for easier authentication by simply tapping the key against a mobile device or other NFC reader. This eliminates the need to physically plug in the key, making the authentication process even more convenient. The NFC-enabled keys are also highly secure, using the same encryption technology as the USB keys. Both types of keys provide strong two-factor authentication, and the choice between them depends on individual preference and device compatibility.

However, it's important to have two YubiKeys as a backup in case you lose one of them or it gets damaged. If you only have one key and it gets lost, stolen, or damaged, you may lose access to your accounts that are secured with two-factor authentication. This can be a major inconvenience or even a security risk, especially if you use your YubiKey for important accounts such as your email, online banking, or other sensitive data.

By having two YubiKeys, you can avoid this issue and have a backup plan in case one key is lost or stolen. You can register both keys with your accounts, so if one key is unavailable, you can use the other key to log in to your accounts. Additionally, having a second key can also provide an extra layer of security, as you can use one key as a backup and keep the other key in a secure location such as a safe or a different physical location.

In summary, having two YubiKeys is important for ensuring that you can maintain access to your accounts if one key is lost, stolen, or damaged. It also provides an extra layer of security and peace of mind.
